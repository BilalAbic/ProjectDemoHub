## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technology Decisions Made
✅ **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14+ (for SSR, routing, optimization)  
✅ **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (matches design references exactly)  
✅ **Backend Framework**: Express.js (simple, flexible)  
✅ **Database**: PostgreSQL (relational data, integrity)  
✅ **ORM**: Prisma (type safety, migrations)  
✅ **Image Storage**: Cloudinary (cloud storage, CDN, transformations)  
✅ **Authentication**: JWT (stateless, scalable)

### Decisions Pending
⏳ **State Management**: React Context + React Query vs Zustand  
⏳ **Testing Framework**: Vitest vs Jest  
⏳ **Deployment Platform**: Railway vs Render vs AWS  
⏳ **Monitoring**: Sentry vs LogRocket vs custom solution  
⏳ **Analytics**: Google Analytics vs custom tracking

### Considerations

#### Database Schema Refinements
Currently defining the exact structure. Key decisions:
- Should we use UUIDs or auto-increment integers for IDs?
  - **Leaning towards**: UUIDs (better for distributed systems, no enumeration)
- Soft delete vs hard delete for projects?
  - **Leaning towards**: Soft delete (allows recovery, audit trail)
- Should project images have an `is_primary` flag?
  - **Yes**: Needed to determine which image shows on project card

#### Image Upload Strategy
- **Option 1**: Upload directly to Cloudinary from frontend
  - **Pros**: Faster, less server load
  - **Cons**: Exposes Cloudinary credentials, harder to validate
- **Option 2**: Upload to backend, then to Cloudinary
  - **Pros**: Better validation, security, control
  - **Cons**: More server load, slower upload
- **Decision**: Option 2 for security and validation

#### Form Validation Strategy
- **Client-side**: React Hook Form with Zod schema validation
- **Server-side**: Express Validator or Joi
- **Both**: Best practice - never trust client

#### Authentication Flow
- **Access Token**: Short-lived (15 min), stored in memory
- **Refresh Token**: Long-lived (7 days), HttpOnly cookie
- **Auto-refresh**: Interceptor refreshes token when expired
- **Logout**: Clear tokens, blacklist (optional with Redis)

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Style Preferences
- **Functional Components**: Always use function syntax, never class components
- **Hooks**: Prefer hooks over HOCs or render props
- **TypeScript**: Use strict mode, avoid `any` type
- **Naming**: 
  - Components: PascalCase (`ProjectCard.tsx`)
  - Functions: camelCase (`fetchProjects`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_BASE_URL`)
  - Files: Match component/function name

### Component Structure
```tsx
// 1. Imports (React, libraries, types, components, styles)
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import { Project } from '@/types';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button';

// 2. Types/Interfaces
interface ProjectCardProps {
  project: Project;
  onClick: () => void;
}

// 3. Component
export const ProjectCard: React.FC<ProjectCardProps> = ({ project, onClick }) => {
  // 4. Hooks
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);
  
  // 5. Event Handlers
  const handleClick = () => {
    onClick();
  };
  
  // 6. Render
  return (
    <div onClick={handleClick}>
      {/* JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Design Analysis Insights

From the provided HTML/CSS references, we learned:

1. **Color Application**:
   - Primary cyan (#06f9f9) used sparingly for accents (buttons, active states, icons)
   - Background dark (#0A1919) for main app background
   - Surface dark (#122B2B) for cards, panels, modals
   - Text hierarchy: #EAEAEA for headings, #A0B0B0 for body

2. **Spacing & Layout**:
   - Generous padding (p-6, p-8) for breathing room
   - Consistent gap values (gap-4, gap-6) for spacing
   - Max-width containers for readability (max-w-7xl)
   - Responsive grid: 1→2→3→4 columns

3. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Subtle hover states (bg-primary/5, bg-white/5)
   - Glow effect on primary buttons (shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(6,249,249,0.3)])
   - Smooth transitions (transition-all duration-200)
   - Backdrop blur for modals (backdrop-blur-md)

4. **Typography**:
   - Monospace font (JetBrains Mono) for:
     - Branding (BilalAbic/DemoHub)
     - Project names
     - Dates
     - Technology tags
   - Display font (Inter) for:
     - Headings
     - Body text
     - UI elements

### API Design Insights

Based on requirements, our API structure:

1. **RESTful Conventions**:
   - Plural nouns for resources (`/projects`, `/technologies`)
   - Nested resources (`/projects/:id/images`)
   - Clear HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

2. **Response Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": { ... },
     "message": "Project created successfully"
   }
   ```

3. **Error Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": {
       "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
       "message": "Invalid project data",
       "details": [
         { "field": "name", "message": "Name is required" }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

### Database Design Insights

1. **Many-to-Many Relationships**:
   - Projects ←→ Technologies (a project can have many technologies, a technology can be used in many projects)
   - Projects ←→ Contributors (a project can have many contributors, a contributor can work on many projects)
   - Use junction tables with additional metadata if needed

2. **One-to-Many Relationships**:
   - Project ←→ Images (a project has many images, an image belongs to one project)
   - Include `display_order` for sorting
   - Include `is_primary` for featured image

3. **Indexing Strategy**:
   - Index on foreign keys (project_id, technology_id)
   - Index on frequently queried fields (created_at, is_published)
   - Composite index on junction tables

### Performance Insights

1. **Image Optimization**:
   - Use Cloudinary transformations in URLs
   - Lazy load images below the fold
   - Use WebP format with JPEG fallback
   - Implement blur-up loading effect

2. **Bundle Optimization**:
   - Code split by route (Next.js automatic)
   - Lazy load admin panel (not needed on public pages)
   - Tree-shake unused Tailwind classes

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Static pages: Cache-Control headers
   - API responses: React Query caching
   - Images: CDN caching (Cloudinary)
   - Frequently accessed data: Redis (future)

## Current Blockers

### None at Present
Currently in planning phase with all required information available.

### Potential Future Blockers
- **Cloudinary Account**: Need to create account and get credentials
- **PostgreSQL Setup**: May need Docker or local installation
- **Deployment**: Need to set up accounts on Vercel/Railway/Render
- **Domain Name**: If custom domain desired

## Questions to Resolve

### For User/Stakeholder
1. Should there be a "draft" mode for projects (unpublished)?
2. Do we need user roles beyond admin (e.g., editor, viewer)?
3. Should there be analytics tracking for project views?
4. Is a search feature needed in addition to filtering?
5. Should projects have categories/tags beyond technologies?

### Technical Questions
1. Maximum number of projects expected? (affects pagination, caching strategy)
2. Expected traffic volume? (affects hosting tier selection)
3. Budget for cloud services? (Cloudinary, hosting, database)
4. Need for automated backups? (database backup strategy)
5. Multi-language support needed? (i18n setup)

## Notes for Future Self

### When Resuming Work
1. Read through all Memory Bank files to get context
2. Check `progress.md` for current status
3. Review `activeContext.md` (this file) for recent changes
4. Look at Git commits for what was last worked on
5. Check TODOs in code for pending tasks

### Key Things to Remember
- Primary color #06f9f9 is used sparingly (accents only)
- All dates in monospace font
- Modals use backdrop-blur for glassmorphism
- Admin panel has sidebar + main content layout
- Public pages have sticky navbar with filters
- Always validate input on both client and server
- Images go through backend to Cloudinary (not direct upload)
- Use UUIDs for IDs (decided above)
- Soft delete for projects (allows recovery)
- Responsive breakpoints: sm:640, md:768, lg:1024, xl:1280, 2xl:1536

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't use `any` type in TypeScript (use proper types)
- Don't skip validation (always validate server-side)
- Don't expose Cloudinary credentials in frontend
- Don't forget to handle loading/error states
- Don't skip accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- Don't commit environment variables (.env in .gitignore)
- Don't hardcode URLs (use environment variables)
- Don't forget to optimize images (use Next.js Image component)

## Communication Preferences

### Code Comments
- Add comments for complex logic
- Document function parameters with JSDoc
- Explain "why" not "what" (code shows what)

### Documentation Updates
- Update Memory Bank when architecture changes
- Document API changes in API docs
- Keep README up to date with setup steps
- Add inline code comments for business logic

### Collaboration
- Create feature branches for all new work
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Open PRs for review (even if solo project - good practice)
- Keep PRs focused and small when possible
